sample code that i've used for prototyping or something like that

in all likelihood the current working codebase has evolved to be incompatible,
so dont take for granted that this will work at all with any existing code in
src/ directory or that external functions called still work the same / have
the same interface / are even intended for the same purposes

im entirely just keeping this around for reference / ideas / to reuse or repourpose.
i put a good amount of brain work into it, so it'll probably be useful in the
future and i don't want to throw it away, unless i'm sure it's better off scrapped.
