- reading into a dynamic text buffer with `load_file(char* filepath)` also loads on some garbage lines/characters
- `show()` prints trailing `(null)` for a few lines, some times
	- i think this was from insert not actually inserting
		but still increasing txt->used. look out for this,
		but if it doesn't come up that was probably the
		source of this bug and you can take this one off
		of the list
