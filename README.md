# shell-prompt-text-editor

Basic old school text editor. Loads file into a background text buffer, view and manipulate it through a command prompt.

## Ok but why??

Is this immediately useful for people to efficiently edit their text? Nope. It's an educational tool, for me mostly. It's cool to understand
the concepts that go in to editing text, and building an application for that quite literally from the ground up. No external libraries, just
pure C code. It's also probably useful for other people to use as an exercise to understand the more rudimentary ways you can manipulate text
with a basic program.

Making this is also really good for me understanding command prompt based applications and how they could be built. Gives me a new appreciation
and perspective for stuff I use more regularly like the `sqlite` shell interface or `gdb` or my Bash prompt, as well as in general pure C programs,
especially ones that have to do text parsing and string manipulation. Programming in pure C is a good exercise in understanding how a computer
actually does stuff and what your higher level languages are doing a level under the hood.

So, this mostly just exists for educational purposes and for trying stuff out. Brownie points if this is a useful in-practice application for
anyone :)
